    <p>Historically, intellectuals have grappled with how, exactly, to represent the Holocaust. Many discuss the "unrepresentability " of the Holocaust. In Alain Resnais&#146s <cite>Night and Fog</cite>, the narrator Michel Bouquet, addresses the audience:</p>

    <p>Bouquet appeals to an idea that we can never express the suffering of those systematically dehumanized and killed; that the state of emotions felt by victims and survivors cannot be replicated without the context of concentration camps and murder, and that any film which attempts to do so is inherently lacking. Despite this, filmmakers (including Resnais himself), have been representing the Holocaust in film since the end of <abbr title="Second World War" class="abbr">WWII</abbr>, and rather than merely struggling with "unrepresentability," they have also grappled with gendered representations of the Holocaust.</p>

    <p>These early filmmakers of Holocaust documentaries fail to address the totality of the Holocaust, and they reinforce stereotypes surrounding the Holocaust by failing to consider the unique experiences had by Jewish women. They fail to explore the intersection of sexism and antisemitism, wherein Jewish women were made vulnerable to rape and sexual assault. Within these documentaries, Jewish women&#146s bodily and psychological trauma are rarely explored, and furthermore Jewish women rarely discuss their own bodies. However, Holocaust filmmaking has been evolving, and more recently women have been given more emphasis as narrators and interviews with women have been used as essential documentary material.</p>

    <p>Following trends in Holocaust historiography, many early documentaries focus solely on men&#146s experiences, or a broad Holocaust narrative which fails to address individual experiences. Even within the academic study of Holocaust history itself, it was not until the 1990s that academics focused on gender-oriented research. Work by major scholars such as Judy Baumel, Myrna Goldenberg, Dalia Ofer, Joan Ringelheim, and Carol Rittner established an understanding of the Holocaust that focused on understanding the ways in which gender engendered different experiences for men and women. This flew in the face of established thought; critics argued that Jewish women were murdered for their Jewishness, not for being women, and that antisemitism and the Nazi Final Solution did not distinguish between men and women.</p>

    <p>Gabriel Schoenfeld, a writer featured in the <cite>New York Times</cite>, the ex-editor of <cite>Commentary</cite>, and author of <cite>The Return of Anti-Semitism</cite>, charged that by focusing on women and comparing their experiences to men, feminist historians were using the Holocaust <q>explicitly to serve the purposes of conscious-raising (i.e., propaganda)</q> which <q>is, as happens, something its practitioners proudly admit, just as they are proud of their use of the Holocaust as a means of validating feminist theory itself.</q><sup><a href = "#fn2" id="rf2">2</a></sup> Gabriel Schoenfeld does not consider the feminist movement valid, especially within Holocaust studies, and directly accuses Joan Ringelheim and Debra Kaufmann of using the Holocaust to advance their academic careers. He expresses a fear that accusation of sexism towards the Nazis would somehow derail conversations about antisemitism, and that labeling Jewish men sexist will lump them in with the Nazis. These are all baseless fears, however, as not a single scholar has ever had the gall to lump Jewish men with the Nazis; to do so would be not only grossly ahistorical, but also supremely unethical. It seems that it is Schoenfeld himself who that carries the bias, which is especially visible when he describes feminists as if they were <q>zealous and accusatory</q> vultures.<sup><a href="#fn3 " id="ref3 ">3</a></sup></p>

    <p>On the opposing side of Schoenfeld, Naama Shik, in an article discussing the trends in gender-oriented historiography, argues that questioning gender-oriented research is <q>no longer relevant.</q><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Shik claims that the contributions of gender-oriented research, along with the participation of top scholars, international conferences, popular books, and huge exhibitions prove that gender issues really are at the core of contemporary research. Weitzman and Ofer point out that <q>questions of gender lead us to a richer and more finely nuanced understanding of the Holocaust.</q><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> Without the narratives of women, we are unable to understand the totality of Nazi dehumanization &mdash; that Jewish people were not just denied their humanity, but that the dehumanization both led to destruction of their gender identities and that degendering itself was a contributor in dehumanization. Without women&#146s narratives, it is impossible to fully grasp the system of forced labor which singled out women with children and pregnant women for extermination. It is also impossible to understand the massive exploitation of Jewish people in the form of slave labor without considering the role of women as sex slaves, in brothels and otherwise. And perhaps most importantly, without gender-oriented study, it is impossible to understand how women have suffered and why many have done so in silence. To assume that Jewish men&#146s experience during the Holocaust &mdash; in ghettos, in labor camps, and in death camps &mdash; is the default experience for all victims of the Holocaust is erroneous.</p>

    <p>The neglect of women&#146s gender-specific experience is a piece of a much wider-spanning problem. In film and popular culture, Jewish victims &mdash; usually men &mdash; are always depicted in the same ways: striped pajamas and tattooed. This is despite the fact that prison garb vastly varied and tattooing was not a feature of all camps; tattooing did not apply at all to those sent to death camps and gassed upon arrival. In popular fictional narratives, very little distinction is made between a concentration (labor, collection and transit, and prisoner of war) camps and extermination camps, and ghettos are either excluded or confused with concentration camps. Furthermore, vastly more victims of the Holocaust were killed in the very homes and villages they lived in, shot in the killing fields of the east and buried in unmarked graves.</p>

    <p>An extreme emphasis is placed on Auschwitz, perhaps due to the influential early English narratives of Primo Levi, Anne Frank, and Elie Wiesel. This can also be contributed to the fact that Auschwitz, as a combination of labor and extermination camp, had a number of survivors, especially among Hungarian Jewish people, who were not deported from Hungary until spring of 1944. This primary public focus on one concentration camp has also contributed to a homogenization of popular narrative, especially dangerous in this case given that very few camps were an official combination of labor and extermination.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Given this trend and the lack of early English translations of narratives by women, this neglect of women is, in part, due to two assumptions: first, that Holocaust narratives are stereotypical, and secondly, that the monolithic Holocaust stereotype is purely based on men&#146s experiences.</p>
