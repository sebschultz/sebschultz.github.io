# holocaustdocumentaries
<p>Thesis on Women's Representation in Holocaust Documentaries, written and defended in 2015 by Sebastian Schultz to fulfill the requirements of departmental honours in the field of Humanities. Thesis advisor Dr. Ann Taylor Allen, with readers Drs Michael Williams and Michael Johmann.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a more accessible way for peoples to read/view the work, with html markup compatable with screen reading technology. Footnote citations also jump down to the reference and allow the user to jump back up to the text.</p>
<p>My custom Javascript introduces a "night mode" that flips the background/text colors and toggles it off.</p>
